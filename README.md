# numberFactsToPhone
A Node app which hits an API for a trivia fact about a user-provided number, and then sends the fact to their phone via Whatsapp! 

Note: This app will only work if you have access to the Twilio Whatsapp sandbox that I used, but if you create your own Twilio Whatsapp sandbox and replace the variable sandboxNumber with your sandbox number, and myNumber with your personal phone number, the code should send the fact to your phone via the sandbox number you provide!
